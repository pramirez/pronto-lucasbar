   <h1>Accessibility Statement</h1> 
   <p>Tootsie's Cabaret is committed to making all of our web content and services, including electronic and information technology, accessible to everyone. To ensure that we meet or exceed the requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the 1998 Amendment to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, we continually review our website and services in order to remove accessibility problems for people with disabilities. While Tootsie's Cabaret commitment to accessibility includes making its web content accessible, this is a work in progress.
